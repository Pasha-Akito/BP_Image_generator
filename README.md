The version of python used to run the scripts is 3.9.13

*** Data Generation ***
`simple_sentence_image_relationships.csv` contains rows matching a symbolic language with the number of the bongard problem it references <br/>

After adding rows, run `python generate_data.py` to generate `expanded_sentence_image_relationships.csv` <br/>
which expands the sentence in `simple_sentence_image_relationships.csv` to match all 36 possible pairs of images


*** Training the transformer model ***
running `python train.py` will start training the model found in transformer_model.py, at the end of training <br/>
the model weights are saved and images can be generated on a text using `python generate_images.py`

*** Outputs ***
outputs contains any images generated by the transformer model from generate_images.py <br/>
While training is happening, the predicted images can be viewed in training_debug as well as <br/>
the real images used to train the model.
