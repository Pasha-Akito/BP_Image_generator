The version of python used to run the scripts is 3.9.13

## Data Generation
`simple_sentence_image_relationships.csv` contains rows matching a symbolic language with the number of the bongard problem it references <br/>

`simple_sentence_image_relationships.csv` contains a maximum of four rows per Bongard Problem, 1 unique symbolic translation per side, as well as the inverse translation of that side <br/>

After adding rows, run `python expand_data.py` to generate `expanded_sentence_image_relationships.csv` <br/>
which expands the sentence in `simple_sentence_image_relationships.csv` to match all 36 possible pairs of images

## Properties File
`properties.py` contains the symbolic language, can add and remove properties.

## Training the transformer model
running `python train.py` will start training the model found in `transformer_model.py`, at the end of training <br/>
the model weights are saved and images can be generated on a text using `python generate_images.py`

## Outputs 
outputs contains any images generated by the transformer model from `generate_images.py` <br/>
While training is happening, the predicted images can be viewed in training_debug as well as <br/>
the real images used to train the model. <br/>
There are example images in output and training_debug
