1,"Empty image vs. non-empty image","existence",CLEAR,CLEAR,
2,"Big vs small","size",CLEAR,CLEAR,
3,"Hollow outline vs. filled in solid","outlined_filled",CLEAR,FAILED,"Looks like the right side struggled to generate anything"
4,"Convex vs concave","concave_convex",FAILED,FAILED,"looks like both sides were trying to generate some shapes, but ended up looking like almost just circles"
5,"Is polygon vs. is smooth without straight lines or corners.","curved_straight",CLEAR,PARTIAL,"The left side has a clear polygon, the right side looks to be trying to generate circular shapes, but nontheless, seems to grasp that curvy lines with no corners is the approach"
6,"Triangle vs quadrilateral","shape",PARTIAL,CLEAR,"On the left, it looks like if you extended the lines it would become a triangle, the right side has a figure resembling a quadrilateral"
7,"Taller than wide vs wider than tall","horizontal_vertical",PARTIAL,CLEAR,"The left looks to be slightly taller than wide"
8,"Positioned right vs positioned left","left_right",CLEAR,CLEAR,"While no shapes are generated, the model only places pixels where the concept dicates. So while no clear shape emerges, the concept is clear."
9,"Non-wiggly outline vs wiggly outline","texture",CLEAR,CLEAR,
10,"Approximately triangular outline vs approximately convex quadrilateral outline","shape",CLEAR,CLEAR,
11,"Thin and elongated vs compact","elongated_compact",FAILED,CLEAR,"elongated image has noise that is elongated, so best case scenario it could be PARTIAL, but keeping it on the FAILED side"
12,"Thin elongated convex hull vs compact convex hull","elongated_compact",CLEAR,CLEAR,"Both images show shapes which could be considered passing the concept, if you place a rubber band around the shapes generated, it would create an elongated vs compact shape"
13,"Tall rectangle OR wide ellipse vs. wide rectangle OR tall ellipse","shape",FAILED,FAILED,"In my opinion, this is somewhat of a unique BP compared to others in the first 100 as it contains an OR, nontheless, the model just struggles to generate good representations for the concept"
14,"All big individual figures vs. all small individual figures","size",CLEAR,CLEAR,
15,"Closed shape outline vs. non-closed curve","closed_open",CLEAR,FAILED,"On the left we have a regular shape genearted, on the right, a perfect circle which is not opened. I think the model fails to see the small openings and just create a closed shape"
16,"Clockwise spiraling curve vs. counter-clockwise spiraling curve","rotation_direction",FAILED,CLEAR,"The left side just fails to have a clear clockwise line, whereas the right side, has a line that moves counter-clickwise"
17,"Shape with a reflex corner vs. shape without a reflex corner","angle",CLEAR,CLEAR,
18,"'Pinched' shape (drastically thinner somewhere in the middle than on the ends) vs. non-pinched shape","neck_narrowing",PARTIAL,PARTIAL,"On the left, exists a figure with a pinched middle, but is quite noisy, I think the model partially understood the concept, but without the noise could become CLEAR. On the right, a very confusing shape has been generated, no pinched shape persay, so keeping at PARTAL"
19,"Horizontal pinch vs. vertical pinch","neck_narrowing",CLEAR,CLEAR,
20,"Both dots touching same bulb vs. dots on opposite bulbs","near_far",FAILED,FAILED,"The model not only failed to generate the large shape, it also failed to put circles on reasonable parts of the large shape"
21,"Small shape present vs. all shapes large","size",CLEAR,CLEAR,
