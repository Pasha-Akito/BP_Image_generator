4,"BP4","shape_geometry",FAILED,FAILED,"looks like both sides were trying to generate some shapes, but ended up looking like almost just circles"
5,"BP5","shape_geometry",CLEAR,PARTIAL,"The left side has a clear polygon, the right side looks to be trying to generate circular shapes, but nontheless, seems to grasp that curvy lines with no corners is the approach"

8,"BP8","spatial_relationship",CLEAR,CLEAR,"While no shapes are generated, the model only places pixels where the concept dicates. So while no clear shape emerges, the concept is clear."

11,"BP11","shape_geometry",CLEAR,CLEAR,
12,"BP12","shape_geometry",CLEAR,CLEAR,"Both images show shapes which could be considered passing the concept, if you place a rubber band around the shapes generated, it would create an elongated vs compact shape"
13,"BP13","shape_geometry",FAILED,FAILED,"In my opinion, this is somewhat of a unique BP compared to others in the first 100 as it contains an OR, nontheless, the model just struggles to generate good representations for the concept"

15,"BP15","shape_geometry",CLEAR,FAILED,"On the left we have a regular shape genearted, on the right, a perfect circle which is not opened. I think the model fails to see the small openings and just create a closed shape"
